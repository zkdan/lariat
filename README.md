Every year since, wow, _2015_, I've hand made a calendar of collages and photocopied it for friends and family. Color copying has been cost prohibitive so I made this little site to show off the color versions of the black and white calendars I give out.

There are a few features still to be implemeneted:
* Progressive image loading
* CSS transitions
* Better UX for the keyboard navigation
